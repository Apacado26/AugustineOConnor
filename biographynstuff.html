        My name is Augustine O'Connor. I am 21 years old, born on April 26th, 2002, on the island of Montreal.
        I grew up in Bainsville, Ontario, and have been a regular resident of Cornwall since starting middle school at Holy Trinity.
        The start to school this year has been very busy: on August 31st of this year, my father adopted the golden retriever seen in the previous page, Sophie.
        On September 21st of this year, my older sister bestowed our family & her boyfriend's family with their first grandchild, my nephew, Fraser.
        I took this photo the day he was born after she called to invite us to the hospital. In Persona 5, one of my favourite video games, there is an iconic painting known as the "Sayuri."
        The painting in-game has a story of highly influencing the art world and perfectly depicting the love of a mother and all the beauty within it.
        After I took this photo, I could immediately see the Sayuri. & I finally understood.
